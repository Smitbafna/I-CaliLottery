# Problem Statement

Traditional lotteries lack transparency, often exclude global participants, and provide little benefit to communities or social causes. Existing fundraising platforms also struggle with fraud, fake identities, and low trust. There’s a need for a verifiable, secure, and community-driven solution where real people can participate in lotteries that fund both winners and meaningful causes. That’s where Civic-powered LottoDAO comes in.

# Solution Statement

LottoDAO solves these problems by combining Civic Auth’s privacy-preserving identity verification with a DAO-governed lottery platform on the Internet Computer. Every lottery is fully transparent, with automated payouts to winners, DAO treasury, and the creator, while embedded wallets ensure seamless participation. This model builds trust, prevents fraud, and channels funds to both players and meaningful social causes turning lotteries into engines for real-world impact.

---

## 1. Verified, Fraud-Resistant Participation

LottoDAO leverages **Civic Auth’s privacy-preserving identity verification** to ensure that only verified, unique humans can participate in lotteries.

This prevents Sybil attacks, fake accounts, and fraudulent fundraising campaigns—creating trust for both players and social cause donors.

By embedding Civic directly into the user experience, LottoDAO ensures that trust and fairness are built into the protocol from day one.



## 2. Automated, Transparent Revenue Sharing

Every lottery launched on LottoDAO features **programmable revenue splits**, with funds automatically distributed between winners, the DAO treasury, and the lottery creator.

This eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces transaction friction, and ensures that contributors and the community are fairly rewarded.

With on-chain transparency, all revenue flows are visible and auditable by anyone.



## 3. DAO-Governed Treasury and Impact Funding

The LottoDAO treasury is governed by its community of token holders, who can propose and vote on how treasury funds are used—whether for platform improvements or charitable contributions.

This creates a **self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem**, where social good is baked into the lottery’s DNA.

Players don’t just buy tickets—they help steer how impact funds are allocated.



## 4. Fully Integrated with the Internet Computer and Web3 Wallets

By building on the **Internet Computer (ICP)**, LottoDAO benefits from scalable, low-cost, and censorship-resistant infrastructure.

**Embedded wallets** provide a seamless, Web3-native experience for participants, making onboarding as simple as signing in with Civic.

Together, Civic + ICP create a powerful combination of security, transparency, and scalability for decentralized fundraising lotteries.

#  Revenue Models for LottoDAO

LottoDAO generates revenue through programmable fee splits embedded in every lottery. A fixed percentage of each ticket purchase goes to the prize pool, a portion to the lottery creator, and a share to the DAO treasury for community growth and development. This creates a sustainable, incentive-aligned ecosystem where participants, creators, and the DAO all benefit transparently.

---

## 1. Ticket Sales (Core Mechanism)

Each lottery operates on **pay-per-ticket** pricing, with embedded wallets (via Civic Auth) handling transactions seamlessly.

### Flow
- User verifies identity via Civic Auth
- User purchases tickets 
- Smart contract executes, recording purchase and contributing to the pool

### Example Pricing
| Item         | Cost     |
|--------------|----------|
| 1 Lottery Ticket | 1 token    |
| Bulk Purchase (10) | 9 tokens    |
| DAO Membership Fee | 2 tokens  |

---

## 2. Revenue Splitting (On-Chain Logic)

Revenue from each ticket purchase is automatically split into multiple destinations:

| Recipient        | Share  |
|------------------|--------|
| Prize Pool       | 70%    |
| Lottery Creator  | 15%    |
| DAO Treasury     | 10%    |
| Social Causes/NGO (optional) | 5%     |

Split logic is **transparent, immutable, and enforced on-chain** by the ICP smart contract.

---

## 3. Creator Incentives

Anyone can launch their own lottery via LottoDAO’s interface:

- Set cause/fundraising target or pure prize pool  
- Earn a percentage of ticket sales  
- Gain reputation within the DAO for successfully run lotteries

> Creates a **permissionless fundraising ecosystem** with direct incentives for creators.

---

## 4. DAO Treasury Growth & Payouts

The DAO treasury accumulates funds from every lottery, building long-term community capital:

- Fund future marketing, development, or community initiatives  
- Propose grants, rewards, or matching donations for verified social causes  
- DAO members vote on treasury allocation regularly

> Ensures **sustainable ecosystem growth** with **community governance**.

---

## 5. Affiliate & Referral Rewards

LottoDAO encourages viral growth via referral incentives:

- Users who share a lottery link earn a percentage of ticket sales (1–5%)  
- Referral tracking is transparent and on-chain 
- Perfect for influencers, community organizers, and partners

> Turns LottoDAO into a **community-powered fundraising engine**.

# How Civic Auth Powers LottoDAO

Civic Auth’s mission is to provide secure, privacy-preserving identity verification and frictionless access to Web3. LottoDAO fully leverages these strengths to build a trustworthy, compliant, and user-friendly decentralized lottery and fundraising platform.

## 1. Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification

Civic verifies that each participant is real and unique without exposing any personal data to LottoDAO or other users. Users maintain anonymity, while Civic provides a cryptographic attestation of uniqueness. This prevents Sybil attacks, bot participation, and fake account farming.

Benefit for LottoDAO:
- Fair, provably unique participation
- Builds trust with participants, donors, and partners
- Compliance-friendly model, supporting regulatory-readiness in lottery-based fundraising

## 2. Frictionless Embedded Wallets

Embedded Wallets are generated seamlessly when a user signs in with Civic Auth. Fully non-custodial and Web3-native, the wallet belongs to the user but requires no external setup. Purchases (lottery tickets, donations) and payouts (winnings, governance rewards) happen in-app.

Benefit for LottoDAO:
- Onboards non-crypto native users smoothly
- Makes buying tickets as easy as using a traditional website, with Web3 benefits
- Automatic, instant payouts to winners through their Civic-embedded wallets

## 3. Proof of Personhood for DAO Governance

Civic provides Proof of Personhood (PoP), a cryptographic guarantee that a voter is a unique individual. One Person = One Vote becomes enforceable without compromising privacy. DAO proposals related to fund distribution, lottery rules, or governance updates are more secure and democratic.

Benefit for LottoDAO:
- Prevents governance capture by whales or bots
- Makes the platform credible to potential partners, NGOs, or regulatory observers
- Aligns with the Web3 vision of democratized, transparent governance

## 4. Compliance, Credibility & Trusted Participation

Civic provides verifiable proofs of identity assurance, while preserving privacy and decentralization. When distributing funds to winners, DAO members, or causes, Civic’s verification layer ensures that real humans are behind each transaction. This strengthens KYC-aligned participation where necessary while avoiding heavy-handed data collection.

Benefit for LottoDAO:
- Builds credibility with community, NGOs, and external stakeholders
- Helps future-proof the project for potential regulatory frameworks in Web3 lotteries and fundraising
- Makes LottoDAO stand out as a compliant-by-design project in the decentralized ecosystem
